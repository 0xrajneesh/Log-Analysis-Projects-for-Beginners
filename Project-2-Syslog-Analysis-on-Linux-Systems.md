# Project 2: Introduction to Syslog Analysis on Linux Systems

## Introduction
In this project, students will learn the basics of syslog analysis on Linux systems. Syslog is a standard logging protocol used to collect and store log messages from various system processes and applications. By the end of this project, students will be able to configure syslog, access and interpret log files, and analyze log data for troubleshooting and security monitoring.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of Linux system administration
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- A Linux machine (preferably Ubuntu)

## Lab Set-up and Tools
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later (or any Linux distribution with syslog configured)
- Access to syslog files (typically located in `/var/log/`)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Understanding Syslog Configuration

**Steps:**

1. Open the syslog configuration file using a text editor:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
    ```
2. Review the configuration directives to understand how syslog is set up.
3. Identify the different logging facilities and their corresponding log files.

**Expected Output:**
- A basic understanding of the syslog configuration, including logging facilities and their destinations.

### Exercise 2: Accessing Syslog Files

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the syslog directory:
    ```bash
    cd /var/log/
    ```
2. List the available syslog files to understand the different log files generated by the system:
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
3. Open the main syslog file using `less` or `cat`:
    ```bash
    less syslog
    ```

**Expected Output:**
- A list of syslog files, with an initial look at the contents of the main syslog file.

### Exercise 3: Filtering Syslog Entries

**Steps:**

1. Use the `grep` command to filter syslog entries based on specific criteria, such as a particular date:
    ```bash
    grep 'Jun 12' syslog
    ```
2. Filter log entries by a specific process or service (e.g., sshd):
    ```bash
    grep 'sshd' syslog
    ```
3. Combine filters to extract more specific information, such as sshd logins on a particular date:
    ```bash
    grep 'Jun 12' syslog | grep 'sshd'
    ```

**Expected Output:**
- A filtered list of syslog entries matching the specified criteria, demonstrating how to extract specific information from log files.

### Exercise 4: Analyzing Authentication Logs

**Steps:**

1. Open the authentication log file using `less` or `cat`:
    ```bash
    less auth.log
    ```
2. Identify different types of authentication events, such as successful logins, failed login attempts, and user changes.
3. Note the timestamps, usernames, and source IP addresses for each event.

**Expected Output:**
- Insight into the types of authentication events logged in the authentication log, including successful and failed login attempts.

### Exercise 5: Summarizing Log Data

**Steps:**

1. Use the `awk` command to summarize log data, such as counting the number of login attempts from each IP address:
    ```bash
    awk '/sshd/ && /Failed password/ {print $11}' auth.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
    ```
2. Summarize the number of successful logins per user:
    ```bash
    awk '/sshd/ && /Accepted password/ {print $9}' auth.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
    ```
3. Identify the most frequent types of syslog messages:
    ```bash
    awk '{print $6}' syslog | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
    ```

**Expected Output:**
- Summarized log data showing the number of login attempts per IP address, successful logins per user, and the most frequent types of syslog messages.

By completing these exercises, students will gain hands-on experience in accessing, filtering, and analyzing syslog files on Linux systems, which are essential skills for system troubleshooting and security monitoring.
